2d-geometry
===========

Two-dimensional intersections made easy.
Inspired by [Programming Languages course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang).
This project owes its existence to a friend of mine [@quepas](https://github.com/quepas) who has published [his work](https://github.com/quepas/Learning-syntax) on the assignments.
Main goal of this project is to start a discussion about double dispatch pattern vs using decorator with strategies provided by a factory.
